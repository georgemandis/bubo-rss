# ðŸ¦‰ Bubo Reader

Bubo Reader is a hyper-minimalist <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> and <acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> feed reader you can deploy on your own server, [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in a few steps or [Glitch](https://glitch.com) in even fewer steps! The goal of the project is to generate a webpage that shows a list of links from a collection of feeds organized by category and website. That's it.

It is named after this [silly robot owl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYSeCfo9-NI) from Clash of the Titans (1981).

You can read more about this project on my blog:

- [Publishing Bubos RSS to Netlify with GitHub Actions](https://george.mand.is/2020/02/publishing-bubos-rss-to-netlify-with-github-actions/)

## Get Started

- Clone or fork the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Update `feeds.json` to include categories and links to feeds you would like to see.
- Run `npm run build:bubo`

That's it! You should now have a static page with links to the latest content from your feeds in the `public` folder, ready to serve.

    <strong>Anatomy of Bubo Reader</strong>
  </summary>

The static pieces:

- `conf/feeds.json` - a JSON file containing your feed URLS separated into categories.
- `config/template.html` - a [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template that lets you change how the feeds are displayed. This can be changed to anything else you likeâ€” see below.
- `public/style.css` - a CSS file to stylize your feed output.
- `public/index.html` - The HTML file that gets automatically generated when Bubo is run.

The engine:

- `src/index.ts` - The primary script you run when you want to build a new version of Bubo. It will automatically fetch the latest content from your feeds and build a new static file at `public/index.html`.
- `src/renderer.ts` â€” The renderer that loads Nunjucks, the template and understands how to process the incoming feed data. Prefer something else? This is the place to change it!
- `src/utilities.ts` â€” A variety of parsing and normalization utilities for Bubo, hidden away to try and keep things clean.

  <summary>
    <strong>Throttling</strong>
  </summary>

In the main `index.ts` file you will find two values that allow you to batch and throttle your feed requests:

- `MAX_CONNECTIONS` dictates the maximum number of requests a batch can have going at once.
- `DELAY_MS` dictates the amount of delay time between each batch.

The default configuration is **no batching or throttling** because `MAX_CONNECTIONS` is set to `Infinity`. If you wanted to change Bubo to only fetch one feed at a time every second you could set these values to:

```javascript
const MAX_CONNECTIONS = 1;
const DELAY_MS = 1000;
```

If you wanted to limit things to 10 simultaneous requests every 2.5 seconds you could set it like so:

```javascript
const MAX_CONNECTIONS = 10;
const DELAY_MS = 2500;
```

In practice, I've never _really_ run into an issue leaving `MAX_CONNECTIONS` set to `Infinity` but this feels like a sensible safeguard to design.

## Deploying to Glitch

The quickest way is to remix the project on Glitch:
[https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bubo-rss](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/bubo-rss)

There is also a `glitch` branch on this repo if you'd prefer to start there.

Just change some feeds in `./config/feeds.json` file and you're set! If you'd like to modify the style or the template you can changed `./public/style.css` file or the `./config/template.html` file respectively.

<a id="netlify"></a>

## Deploying to Netlify

- [Fork the repository](https://github.com/georgemandis/bubo-rss/fork)
- From your forked repository edit `config/feeds.json` to manage your feeds and categories
- [Create a new site](https://app.netlify.com/start) on Netlify from GitHub

The deploy settings should automatically import from the `netlify.toml` file. All you'll need to do is confirm and you're ready to go!

### Keeping Feeds Updated

#### Using Netlify Webhooks

To keep your feeds up to date you'll want to [setup a Build Hook](https://www.netlify.com/docs/webhooks/#incoming-webhooks) for your Netlify site and use another service to ping it every so often to trigger a rebuild. I'd suggest looking into:

- [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)
- [EasyCron](https://www.easycron.com/)

#### Rolling Your Own

If you already have a server running Linux and some command-line experience it might be simpler to setup a [cron job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).
